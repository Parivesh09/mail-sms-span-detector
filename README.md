# Email/SMS Spam Detector

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based Email/SMS Spam Detector. The detector is trained on a dataset of labeled messages to classify whether a given message is spam or not. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as text preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization, along with a machine learning model (XGBoost) to make predictions.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** The input messages undergo text preprocessing to convert them into a suitable format for machine learning analysis. This includes lowercasing, tokenization, removing stopwords, and stemming.

- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** The preprocessed messages are transformed into TF-IDF vectors, capturing the importance of words in each message.

- **XGBoost Model:** The TF-IDF vectors are used as input to an XGBoost machine learning model, which has been trained to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.

- **Web Interface:** The project includes a simple web interface built with Streamlit and Flask, allowing users to input a message and receive an instant prediction on whether it is spam or not.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-detector.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the web application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to use the Email/SMS Spam Detector.
